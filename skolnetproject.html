    <h1>Network Design Project Overview</h1>
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>Enhance connectivity, ensure security, and manage content access in a school setting according to UK compliance standards.</p>
<hr>
    <h2>Components:</h2>
    <div class="component">
        <h3>Router:</h3>
        <p>Installed a high-performance router to manage the incoming internet connection from the ISP, acting as the gateway for all network traffic. Configured with robust firewall settings to secure the network perimeter.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="component">
        <h3>Switch:</h3>
        <p>A managed network switch was deployed to connect all wired devices within the school, including servers, desktop PCs, and network endpoints. This switch provides VLANs for segmenting the network (e.g., student network, staff network, guest network).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="component">
        <h3>WiFi Endpoints:</h3>
        <p>Four WiFi access points (APs) were strategically placed around the school to provide comprehensive wireless coverage. These APs were configured to broadcast multiple SSIDs for different user groups, ensuring that guest access did not interfere with educational activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="component">
        <h3>Centralized DNS Server:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up a local DNS server to handle domain name resolution.</li>
            <li>Crucial for DNS filtering to block access to unauthorized websites, ensuring compliance with educational content standards.</li>
            <li>Logging and monitoring web traffic for security and compliance reporting.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="component">
        <h3>Screen Monitoring and Management Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Installed on over 20 school PCs, this software allows:</li>
            <li>Remote monitoring of student computer screens by teachers or admin staff.</li>
            <li>Management capabilities like locking screens, pushing notifications, or initiating software updates across multiple machines simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
<hr>
    <h2>Installation Process:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Site Survey:</strong> Conducted a preliminary survey to determine optimal locations for WiFi endpoints for maximum coverage and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Cabling and Infrastructure:</strong> Laid new or utilized existing network cabling to connect the switch, router, and WiFi endpoints. Ensured all hardware was securely mounted and accessible for maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up the router with appropriate WAN settings, DHCP for IP address distribution, and initial firewall rules.</li>
                <li>Configured the switch with VLANs to segment traffic, improving network performance and security.</li>
                <li>WiFi endpoints were configured with security protocols (WPA3), SSID settings, and band steering for efficient use of 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Software Installation:</strong> Deployed screen monitoring software on school PCs, ensuring integration with the centralized management system for ease of use by teachers.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Server Setup:</strong> Configured the DNS server with blacklists and filters for web content, integrated with UK educational standards for content filtering.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing and Optimization:</strong> Conducted thorough testing to ensure connectivity, speed, and security features were working as intended. Optimized the WiFi setup based on initial usage data to avoid congestion and ensure coverage in all learning areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Seamless internet access across the school with robust WiFi coverage.</li>
        <li>Enhanced security through content filtering, ensuring compliance with educational standards.</li>
        <li>Effective management of digital resources, allowing teachers to focus on teaching rather than IT management.</li>
        <li>A scalable solution that can accommodate future growth or technological upgrades within the school.</li>
    </ul>
